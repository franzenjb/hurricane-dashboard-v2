# üåÄ Hurricane Intelligence Platform V2

**Advanced Hurricane Data Assistant & Analytics Tool**  
Interactive Atlantic Hurricane Timeline, Multi-State Tracker, and AI-Powered Intelligence System with complete HURDAT2 database (1851-2024).

## üéØ Mission
Transform 173 years of hurricane data into actionable intelligence for disaster response, research, and public safety.

## ‚ö° Quick Start

### Option 1: Local Development
```bash
# Run local web server (avoids CORS issues)
./run-local.sh

# Then open: http://localhost:8000
```

### Option 2: Live Deployment
Access the live dashboard at: https://franzenjb.github.io/hurricane-dashboard-v2/

### Development Workflow (Recommended)
```bash
# Start local server for rapid development
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Open Chrome DevTools ‚Üí Network tab ‚Üí Check "Disable cache"
# This ensures instant updates when you save files

# When ready to deploy:
git add .
git commit -m "description"
git push
```

## Git Best Practices

### Understanding Git Push Behavior
When working with Git, it's important to understand how pushes work:
- **Interrupted pushes are safe**: If a push is interrupted before completion, your local commits remain intact
- **Only committed changes get pushed**: Uncommitted changes stay local until you commit them
- **Local commits are preserved**: Git handles interrupted operations gracefully

### Recommended Git Workflow
```bash
# 1. Check current status
git status                    # See what's staged/unstaged
git log origin/main..HEAD     # See commits that will be pushed

# 2. Stage and commit changes
git add .                     # Stage all changes (or specify files)
git commit -m "Clear description of what changed"

# 3. Push to remote repository
git push origin main

# If push is interrupted, simply run git push again
```

### Important Git Rules
- **Always commit locally first**: Changes must be committed before they can be pushed
- **Check status before committing**: Use `git status` to understand what will be included
- **Write clear commit messages**: Describe what changed and why
- **Push immediately after committing**: This ensures changes are backed up and visible on GitHub
- **Interrupted pushes can be retried**: Just run `git push` again if interrupted

## üöÄ AI Assistant Deployment

### Current Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Basic Pattern Matching
The AI Assistant currently uses simple pattern matching and returns generic responses. To enable true AI intelligence:

### Option 1: Deploy Claude-Powered Worker (Recommended)
**Time Required: 10 minutes**

1. **Get Anthropic API Key** (5 min)
   - Visit https://console.anthropic.com/
   - Create account and generate API key
   - Copy key (starts with `sk-ant-`)

2. **Update Cloudflare Worker** (3 min)
   - Go to https://workers.cloudflare.com/
   - Open your `hurricane-ai-simple` worker
   - Replace code with `ai-powered-worker.js`
   - Save and Deploy

3. **Add API Key** (2 min)
   - Settings ‚Üí Variables
   - Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable
   - Save and Deploy

4. **Test Enhanced AI**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "https://hurricane-ai-simple.jbf-395.workers.dev/" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"query": "When do hurricanes hit west Florida?"}'
   ```

### Option 2: Use Free Cloudflare AI
No API key needed - uses Cloudflare's built-in models. See `WORKER_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` for details.

### Expected Improvements After Deployment
| Feature | Before (Current) | After (AI-Powered) |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Storm Info | "Looking at Hurricane Ida" | Detailed analysis of actual storms |
| Temporal Analysis | Generic response | "West Florida peaks Sept-Oct, vulnerable to Gulf storms" |
| 2024 Knowledge | None | Full details on Helene, Milton impacts |
| Filter Suggestions | Basic pattern match | Smart, context-aware recommendations |
| Historical Context | None | Comparisons to Andrew, Charley, Irma |

## Troubleshooting

**Storm tracks showing as single points?**
- Ensure you're using http://localhost:8000 or the GitHub Pages URL
- Local file:// URLs are blocked by CORS policy

**Layout issues?**
- Clear browser cache and hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Check browser console for errors

## üí¨ Sample AI Assistant Queries (After Deployment)

### Questions It Can Answer:
- **Temporal Patterns**: "When do hurricanes typically hit west Florida?"
- **Historical Analysis**: "What were the worst hurricanes to hit Tampa Bay?"
- **2024 Season**: "Tell me about Hurricane Milton's impact"
- **Comparisons**: "How does 2024 compare to 2004 for Florida?"
- **Geographic Vulnerability**: "Why is Tampa Bay vulnerable to storm surge?"
- **Category Analysis**: "Show me all Category 5 hurricanes since 2000"
- **State-Specific**: "Which hurricanes hit both Florida and Louisiana?"
- **Impact Assessment**: "What was the deadliest hurricane in US history?"

### Current Limitations (Before Deployment):
- Returns generic responses like "Looking at Hurricane Ida"
- No real hurricane knowledge or analysis
- Cannot answer specific questions about timing, impacts, or patterns
- Filters don't match the actual query intent
