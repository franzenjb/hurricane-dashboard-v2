## ðŸ§ª Test Your New AI

### Quick Browser Test
1. Open your dashboard: https://franzenjb.github.io/hurricane-dashboard-v2/
2. Look for the **purple chat button** in the bottom right
3. Click it and ask: "Tell me about Hurricane Milton"
4. You should get a detailed, intelligent response!

### Command Line Test
```bash
./test-ai-assistant.sh
```

This will show you the difference between the old and new responses.

## ðŸŽ‰ What You'll Get

### Before (Current Worker)
```
Query: "When do hurricanes hit west Florida?"
Response: "Looking at Hurricane Ida. Showing only storms that made landfall."
```

### After (With Your API Key)
```
Query: "When do hurricanes hit west Florida?"
Response: "West Florida faces its highest hurricane risk from August through October, 
with September being the peak month. The 2024 season demonstrated this pattern 
dramatically with Hurricane Helene making a catastrophic Category 4 landfall in 
the Big Bend area on September 26, followed by Hurricane Milton striking near 
Sarasota as a Category 3 on October 9. The region's vulnerability stems from 
warm Gulf waters that fuel rapid intensification and a coastline orientation 
that's perpendicular to typical storm tracks..."
```

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### "API Key Invalid" Error
- Make sure you copied the full key including `sk-ant-api-`
- Check that the variable name is exactly `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- Ensure you clicked "Encrypt" when adding the variable

### No Response / Timeout
- The worker URL should be: `https://hurricane-ai-simple.jbf-395.workers.dev/`
- Check the Cloudflare dashboard for any error logs
- Try the fallback option below

### Want to Use Free Cloudflare AI Instead?
If you don't want to pay for Anthropic API, in your worker code find line 73-104 and replace with:
```javascript
// Use Cloudflare's free AI
const aiResponse = await env.AI.run('@cf/meta/llama-2-7b-chat-int8', {
  messages: [
    { role: 'system', content: hurricaneContext },
    { role: 'user', content: query }
  ]
});
const aiAnswer = aiResponse.response;
```

## âœ… Success Checklist

- [ ] Got Anthropic API key from https://console.anthropic.com/
- [ ] Replaced worker code with `ai-powered-worker.js`
- [ ] Added `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable
- [ ] Clicked "Save and Deploy" in Cloudflare
- [ ] Tested with "Tell me about Hurricane Milton"
- [ ] Got detailed, intelligent response
- [ ] Chat button appears in dashboard

## ðŸ“ž Still Need Help?

1. **Check worker logs:** Cloudflare dashboard > Your worker > Logs
2. **Verify API key:** Make sure it starts with `sk-ant-api-`
3. **Test directly:** Run `./test-ai-assistant.sh`
4. **Fallback option:** Use Cloudflare AI (free, see above)

**Your dashboard is ready!** Once you complete these steps, your AI assistant will provide intelligent, detailed responses about hurricanes with full 2024 season knowledge including Helene and Milton impacts.
