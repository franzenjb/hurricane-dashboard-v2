The storm reached maximum sustained winds of 130 mph with a minimum central pressure of 928 mb, producing extreme hurricane winds across the affected regions. The storm's track brought significant impacts across multiple states, demonstrating the far-reaching effects of major Atlantic hurricanes. The major hurricane caused significant structural damage, widespread power outages, and flooding, highlighting the vulnerability of coastal communities to intense tropical cyclones."

The storm reached maximum sustained winds of 105 mph with a minimum central pressure of 942 mb, producing major hurricane winds across the affected regions. The storm's track brought significant impacts across multiple states, demonstrating the far-reaching effects of major Atlantic hurricanes. The major hurricane caused significant structural damage, widespread power outages, and flooding, highlighting the vulnerability of coastal communities to intense tropical cyclones."
