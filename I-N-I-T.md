# I-N-I-T: Hurricane Dashboard Status & TODO

## üî¥ CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX FIRST
1. **Database Tab Broken Features**
   - "Compare Selected" button doesn't work
   - "View" link doesn't work  
   - Need to find where these buttons are actually implemented

2. **Live Weather Features Broken**
   - Current weather displays not functioning
   - Need to check API connections

3. **Intelligence Tab - Fake Links**
   - TCR (Tropical Cyclone Reports) links are fake placeholders
   - Shows PDF/KMZ/Shapefile links that don't exist
   - Location: `intelligence-tab.html` lines 506-535

## ‚úÖ WHAT'S WORKING
- **Timeline Tab**: Shows hurricanes by year with filters
- **Regional Tab**: Multi-state analysis  
- **Core Database**: 1,991 storms from HURDAT2 (1851-2024)
- **Red Cross Tools**: Shelter Predictor & Language Needs (deployed)
- **Storm Visualizations**: Path intersections, speed runs (partially working)

## üöß INCOMPLETE FEATURES (Started but not finished)
1. **Storm Intersection Visualizer** 
   - Heat map of path crossings - UI exists but needs real data
   
2. **Hurricane Speed Runs**
   - Animated replays - framework built but not connected to real tracks
   
3. **Leaderboards** 
   - Fastest/strongest/longest storms - placeholders only
   
4. **Animated Storm Replay System**
   - Can replay any of 1,991 storms - needs track data integration

5. **Hurricane Coincidence Finder**
   - UI created but logic not implemented

## üìù TOMORROW'S PRIORITY ORDER
1. **FIX Database Tab buttons** (Compare/View)
2. **FIX Live weather features** 
3. **REMOVE fake TCR links** from intelligence tab
4. **COMPLETE Storm replay system** with real track data
5. **FINISH Coincidence finder** logic

## üóÇÔ∏è KEY FILES
- `index.html` - Main dashboard container
- `enhanced-database.html` - Database tab (in iframe)
- `intelligence-tab.html` - Has the fake TCR links (lines 506-535)
- `storm-visualizations.js` - Incomplete intersection/replay features
- `redcross-tools.js` - Working shelter/language predictors
- `atlantic-storms-enhanced.js` - Main database (1,991 storms)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è USER FRUSTRATIONS
- AI assistant was complete failure - removed
- Q&A tool didn't work - removed  
- Multiple features show but don't actually work
- User wants WORKING features, not more broken demos

## üéØ PHILOSOPHY GOING FORWARD
- **Fix existing broken features FIRST**
- **Test everything before claiming it works**
- **Complete started features before adding new ones**
- **Actually use the real storm database, not fake data**
